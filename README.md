# Nathanielãƒ¼@Nattea05
Hey there! I'm Nathaniel, a fullstack developer who loves to incorporate outside influences from things that interest me into my own projects, putting my own twist on them. I previously worked at a startup as a Junior Software Developer where I worked with my peers to design and develop a tenant-based passthrough with payment gateway service integrations using Restful API.
